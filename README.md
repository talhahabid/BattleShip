# Battleship Game

## Description

This is a simple implementation of **Battleship** in Java. The player attempts to guess the location of hidden ships placed by the computer. The grid is 10x10, and ships are randomly placed vertically or horizontally. The player guesses by providing row and column coordinates, and the program will indicate whether the guess was a hit "H" or a miss "O". The game continues until all ships are hit.
